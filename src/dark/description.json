 {"description": "I’ve been passionate about software design/development since I was young. Learn by doing software development carried me through my early childhood as an interest. Since then, I knew that I wanted to pursue software development as my career. Thus I got my bachelor’s degree in CS major at the University of British Columbia. For my previous job, our team goal was to accomplish an educational website for beekeepers to provide awareness for the bee industry or people who have an interest in joining the industry. This role established my problem-solving skills as well as the ability to work in a team environment. Moreover, it made me aware of how a successful project could possibly impact our society. Moving forward I would love to develop and improve my problem-solving skills in a software environment."
